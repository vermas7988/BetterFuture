# BetterFuture
A Scala library for people like me who don't want to go with pure FP IO's but want something easily interoperable with Futures and tries to use their power to the most with better api. It tries to sit on the top of Scala Future with assumption that code inside it can either fail or return a result and implements some common methods to compose functions.
